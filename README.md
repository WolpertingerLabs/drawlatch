# Drawlatch

> **Alpha Software:** Expect breaking changes between updates.

Drawlatch is a config-driven proxy that gives AI agents authenticated access to external APIs. Define your connections and secrets in a single config file — agents get structured, allowlisted access to 23 pre-built APIs without ever seeing your credentials.

**Using [Callboard](https://github.com/WolpertingerLabs/callboard)?** Drawlatch is built in — Callboard manages connections, secrets, and agent identities through its UI. You don't need to set up drawlatch separately.

## Key Features

- **23 pre-built connections** — GitHub, Slack, Discord, Stripe, Notion, Linear, OpenAI, and [more](CONNECTIONS.md)
- **Endpoint allowlisting** — agents can only reach explicitly configured URL patterns
- **Per-caller access control** — each agent identity sees only its assigned connections
- **Real-time event ingestion** — WebSocket, webhook, and polling listeners for incoming events ([details](INGESTORS.md))
- **Two operating modes** — remote (secrets on a separate server with E2EE) or local (in-process library)

## How It Works

Drawlatch runs in two modes depending on your trust model:

### Remote Mode — Secrets Never Leave the Server

The local MCP proxy holds no secrets. It encrypts requests and forwards them to a remote server that injects credentials and makes the actual API calls.

```
┌──────────────┐                          ┌──────────────────┐                    ┌──────────────┐
│  Claude Code  │◄── stdio ──► MCP Proxy  │◄── HTTP + E2EE ──►  Remote Server    │── HTTPS ────►│  External API │
│              │              (no secrets) │                   │  (holds secrets)  │              │               │
└──────────────┘                          └──────────────────┘                    └──────────────┘
```

The crypto layer uses Ed25519 signatures for mutual authentication and X25519 ECDH to derive AES-256-GCM session keys — all built on Node.js native `crypto` with zero external dependencies.

### Local Mode — In-Process Library

No server, no encryption. Your application imports drawlatch directly and calls the same `executeProxyRequest()` function the remote server uses. Secrets come from `process.env` on the same machine.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐                    ┌──────────────┐
│  Your Application                        │── HTTPS ──────────►│  External API │
│  ┌──────────┐   in-process   ┌────────┐ │                    │               │
│  │  Agent   │◄── call ──────►│ drawl. │ │                    └──────────────┘
│  └──────────┘                └────────┘ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

You still get config-driven route resolution, endpoint allowlisting, per-caller access control, and ingestor support — just without cryptographic secret isolation.

> **When to use which:** Remote mode when secrets must be hidden from the agent's machine (shared servers, CI, untrusted environments). Local mode when running on your own machine and you want convenience without a separate server.

## Quick Start

Get from zero to working in three commands:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @wolpertingerlabs/drawlatch

# Set up keys, config, and .env in one step
drawlatch init --connections github

# Set your API token (edit the file or run this)
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here" >> ~/.drawlatch/.env

# Start the remote server
drawlatch start
```

Verify your setup:

```bash
drawlatch doctor    # Validate full setup
drawlatch status    # Check server is running
drawlatch config    # View configuration and secret status
```

The `init` command generates keys, creates configs, exchanges public keys, and scaffolds the `.env` file. All steps are idempotent — safe to re-run.

### Connect to Claude Code

**Option 1: Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)**

```shell
# Install the plugin
/plugin install drawlatch@drawlatch
```

The plugin's MCP server starts automatically. The proxy uses `~/.drawlatch/` by default — see [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) to use a custom path.

**Option 2: Auto-Discovery**

This repo includes a `.mcp.json` file, so Claude Code automatically discovers the MCP proxy when you open the project. Approve the server when prompted.

**Option 3: Manual Registration**

```bash
claude mcp add drawlatch \
  -e MCP_CONFIG_DIR=~/.drawlatch \
  -- node /path/to/drawlatch/dist/mcp/server.js
```

> **Note:** Auto-discovery and manual registration use `dist/mcp/server.js`. The `dist/` directory is built automatically via `npm install` (prepare script). Rebuild manually with `npm run build` if needed.

### Manual Setup

For custom setups (different aliases, multiple callers, different machines), you can configure everything manually instead of using `drawlatch init`.

**1. Generate keys:**

```bash
drawlatch generate-keys caller my-laptop
drawlatch generate-keys server
```

**2. Exchange public keys** — on separate machines, copy `*.pub.pem` files to the matching `keys/callers/<alias>/` or `keys/server/` directory on the other machine. See [Key Exchange](#key-exchange) for details.

**3. Create configs** — copy the example files and edit:

```bash
cp remote.config.example.json ~/.drawlatch/remote.config.json
cp proxy.config.example.json ~/.drawlatch/proxy.config.json
```

**4. Create a `.env` file** with your API secrets:

```bash
cat > ~/.drawlatch/.env << 'EOF'
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
# DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
EOF
```

**5. Start the server:**

```bash
drawlatch start
drawlatch doctor    # Validate full setup
```

## Admin Dashboard

`drawlatch start` serves a built-in web dashboard — a React single-page app — that **fully manages** your running daemon: enable/disable connections per caller, set and clear secrets, create and delete callers, configure and control event listeners (start/stop/restart, multi-instance management), and watch the live event/log feed — all from the browser, no config-file editing required. Every change is applied with a **live reload** (the daemon re-resolves routes and ingestors in place), so there is no "restart to apply" step. drawlatch owns 100% of its own state through this password-gated surface; nothing external writes its config.

### Architecture

There is no separate UI service to run. The React app, the `/api/admin/*` API, and the MCP protocol endpoints (`/handshake`, `/request`, `/events`, `/webhooks`, …) are all served by the **same Express process on the same port** as the daemon (default `http://127.0.0.1:9999/`):

```
┌────────────────────────────── drawlatch daemon (one process, port 9999) ──────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                                                        │
│   GET /                 →  React SPA (served from frontend/dist in production)                          │
│   /api/admin/*          →  read + mutating JSON API  ──┐                                                │
│   POST /api/auth/*      →  login / logout / check       ├─ password-gated (session cookie)              │
│   /handshake /request … →  MCP protocol (E2EE)         ─┘  ← unaffected by dashboard auth               │
│                                                                                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Any unmatched non-API GET falls back to `index.html` so client-side routing works. The MCP protocol endpoints are independent of the dashboard — they keep serving agents even when the dashboard is locked (see below).

### Setup

**1. Set a password** (required — the dashboard is locked until one is set):

```bash
drawlatch set-password          # prompts on a TTY, or reads a password piped on stdin
# echo 'my-strong-password' | drawlatch set-password   # non-interactive
```

The password is hashed with **scrypt** (random 16-byte salt, verified with a constant-time compare); the hash + salt are written to `~/.drawlatch/.env` (`AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` / `AUTH_PASSWORD_SALT`, mode `0600`). Your plaintext password is never stored. Use `drawlatch change-password` (an alias of the same command) to rotate it later — rotating signs out every other session.

**2. Open the dashboard** at `http://127.0.0.1:9999/` and log in. `drawlatch status` prints the dashboard URL and whether a password is configured.

### Pages

| Page | Route | What it shows | Refresh |
|------|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Overview** | `/` | Daemon health at a glance: status, PID, port, version, uptime, active session count, ingestor state breakdown, and secrets-configured progress. | on load |
| **Connections** | `/connections` | Full management: connections grouped by category with search + a stable/beta/dev filter; a caller selector with create/delete-caller; per-connection enable toggle, secrets modal, test connection/listener, listener config panel (all field types + multi-instance), and quick start/stop/restart — with live ingestor state dots and secret-status badges. | live (5s) |
| **Logs** | `/logs` | Live event/log feed per caller — ingestor status cards, source filter pills, and expandable event rows (eventType, ids, timestamps, pretty-printed JSON payload). | every 5s |
| **Callers** | `/callers` | Registered MCP callers — alias, name, connection count, key fingerprint, and whether their keys directory exists. Click through for a caller's connections and secret status. | on load |
| **Ingestors** | `/ingestors` | Live table of every running ingestor (WebSocket / webhook / poll) — state, buffered event count, total events received, last activity, and any error. | every 2s |
| **Sessions** | `/sessions` | Active MCP proxy sessions — caller alias, created/last-active times, request count, and current per-window request rate. | every 5s |
| **Secrets** | `/secrets` | A (caller × connection × secret) matrix showing required/optional and present/missing — with a "only missing" filter. **Never shows secret values**, only whether each is set. | every 10s |

### The `/api/admin/*` API

The pages are views over the `/api/admin/*` JSON API. **Read** endpoints (`/meta`, `/health`, `/connections`, `/callers`, `/callers/:alias/connection-status`, `/callers/:alias/connections`, `/callers/:alias/ingestors`, `/callers/:alias/events`, `/ingestors`, `/sessions`, `/secrets`) **never return a secret value** — caller `env` maps are reduced to key *names*, secret state is reported as booleans, and session crypto material is never serialized.

**Mutating** endpoints (all behind the password gate) let the dashboard own management end-to-end:

| Method + path | Action |
|---|---|
| `POST /callers` | Create a caller **with a fresh keypair** (no interactive sync) |
| `DELETE /callers/:alias` | Delete a caller (its keys + prefixed env vars); `default` is protected |
| `POST /callers/:alias/connections/:connection` `{enabled}` | Enable/disable a connection |
| `PUT  /callers/:alias/connections/:connection/secrets` `{secrets}` | Set/clear secrets (empty string = delete) — **write-only**, read back as booleans |
| `POST /callers/:alias/connections/:connection/test` · `/test-ingestor` | Run a connection / listener test |
| `POST /callers/:alias/connections/:connection/listener/control` `{action,instance_id?}` | Start/stop/restart a listener |
| `GET/PUT /…/listener/params`, `GET/POST/DELETE /…/listener/instances[/:id]`, `POST /…/listener/resolve-options` | Listener params + multi-instance management |

Secrets are **write-only** through this API: you `PUT` values, and every read path reports only booleans. After any mutation the daemon live-reloads routes/ingestors for the affected caller. The same logic powers the encrypted MCP tools and the admin API through a single shared `tool-dispatch` module, so the two surfaces can never drift.

A loopback-only `POST /sync/auto-enroll` lets a **co-located** client (one that shares drawlatch's filesystem) provision a caller with zero interaction by presenting the one-time token drawlatch writes to `~/.drawlatch/enroll.token` at startup.

### Security model

The **password is the trust boundary** for the dashboard and `/api/admin/*` — not loopback. That lets you expose the dashboard to a LAN by binding a non-loopback host:

```bash
DRAWLATCH_HOST=0.0.0.0 drawlatch start    # or: drawlatch start --host 0.0.0.0
```

Auth uses a `drawlatch_session` cookie that is `httpOnly` and `sameSite=strict`, with a **7-day rolling expiry** (every authenticated request extends it). Login, password-change, and auth-check endpoints are rate-limited per IP (5/min for login & change-password, 20/min for checks). If **no** password is configured, the daemon still starts and serves MCP normally — only the dashboard is locked: `/api/auth/*` and `/api/admin/*` return `503` and the SPA shows a locked state prompting `drawlatch set-password`. The daemon never exits just because the dashboard is unconfigured.

> **Cookies run over plain HTTP** on loopback/LAN (no `secure` flag). Put the daemon behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy if you expose it beyond a trusted network.

> **Migrating from `drawlatch-ui`?** The standalone `drawlatch-ui` service and its `~/.drawlatch-ui/` config directory are abandoned — its dashboard, auth gate, and password now live inside drawlatch. There is no automatic migration: just run `drawlatch set-password` once to set the password in `~/.drawlatch/.env`.

## MCP Tools

Once connected, agents get these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `secure_request` | Make authenticated HTTP requests. Route-level headers (auth tokens, API keys) are injected automatically — the agent never sees secret values. Supports JSON and multipart/form-data file uploads. |
| `list_routes` | Discover available APIs with metadata, docs links, allowed endpoints, and available secret placeholders. |
| `poll_events` | Retrieve buffered events from ingestors (Discord messages, GitHub webhooks, etc.) with cursor-based pagination. |
| `ingestor_status` | Get connection state, buffer sizes, event counts, and errors for all active ingestors. |
| `test_connection` | Verify API credentials with a pre-configured read-only request. |
| `control_listener` | Start, stop, or restart an event listener. |
| `list_listener_configs` | Get configurable fields for event listeners. |
| `set_listener_params` | Configure listener parameters (filters, buffer sizes, etc.). |
| `get_listener_params` | Read current listener parameter overrides. |
| `resolve_listener_options` | Fetch dynamic options for listener config fields (e.g., list of Trello boards). |
| `list_listener_instances` | List instances of a multi-instance listener. |
| `delete_listener_instance` | Remove a multi-instance listener instance. |
| `test_ingestor` | Test event listener configuration and credentials. |

## Configuration Reference

### Remote Server Config (`remote.config.json`)

```json
{
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 9999,
  "connectors": [],
  "callers": {},
  "rateLimitPerMinute": 60
}
```

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `host` | Network interface to bind | `127.0.0.1` |
| `port` | Listen port | `9999` |
| `connectors` | Custom connector definitions (see below) | `[]` |
| `callers` | Per-caller access control (see below) | `{}` |
| `rateLimitPerMinute` | Max requests per minute per session | `60` |

Server keys are always loaded from `keys/server/` inside the config directory.

### Callers

Each caller is identified by their public key and declares which connections they can access:

```json
{
  "callers": {
    "alice": {
      "name": "Alice (senior engineer)",
      "connections": ["github", "stripe", "internal-api"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${ALICE_GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      }
    },
    "ci-server": {
      "name": "GitHub Actions CI",
      "connections": ["github"]
    }
  }
}
```

Caller public keys are loaded automatically from `keys/callers/<alias>/` — no path configuration needed.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `connections` | Yes | Array of connection names (built-in or custom connector aliases) |
| `name` | No | Human-readable name for audit logs |
| `env` | No | Per-caller env var overrides — redirect secret resolution per caller |
| `ingestorOverrides` | No | Per-caller ingestor config overrides ([details](INGESTORS.md#caller-level-ingestor-overrides)) |

The `env` map lets multiple callers share the same connection with different credentials:
- Keys are the env var names connectors reference (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- Values are `"${REAL_ENV_VAR}"` (redirect) or literal strings (direct injection)
- Checked before prefixed env vars during secret resolution

Without an explicit `env` mapping, secrets resolve via prefixed env vars (e.g., caller "alice" + `GITHUB_TOKEN` → `ALICE_GITHUB_TOKEN`).

### Custom Connectors

Define reusable route templates for APIs not covered by built-in connections:

```json
{
  "connectors": [
    {
      "alias": "internal-api",
      "name": "Internal Admin API",
      "allowedEndpoints": ["https://admin.internal.com/**"],
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${ADMIN_KEY}" },
      "secrets": { "ADMIN_KEY": "${INTERNAL_ADMIN_KEY}" }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `alias` | Yes | Unique name for referencing from caller `connections` lists |
| `allowedEndpoints` | Yes | Glob patterns for allowed URLs |
| `name` | No | Human-readable name |
| `description` | No | Short description |
| `docsUrl` | No | URL to API documentation |
| `headers` | No | Headers to auto-inject (`${VAR}` placeholders resolved from `secrets`) |
| `secrets` | No | Key-value pairs — literal strings or `${ENV_VAR}` references |
| `resolveSecretsInBody` | No | Resolve `${VAR}` in request bodies (default: `false`) |

Custom connectors with an `alias` matching a built-in connection name take precedence.

### Proxy Config (`proxy.config.json`)

Used by the local MCP proxy to connect to the remote server:

```json
{
  "remoteUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:9999",
  "connectTimeout": 10000,
  "requestTimeout": 30000
}
```

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `remoteUrl` | URL of the remote server | `http://localhost:9999` |
| `connectTimeout` | Handshake timeout (ms) | `10000` |
| `requestTimeout` | Request timeout (ms) | `30000` |

Key paths are derived automatically — no configuration needed:
- Caller keys: `keys/callers/{MCP_KEY_ALIAS || "default"}/`
- Server public keys: `keys/server/`

### Advanced Configuration

#### `MCP_CONFIG_DIR` — the config-dir contract

By default, all config and key files live in `~/.drawlatch/`. Override with:

```bash
export MCP_CONFIG_DIR=/custom/path/to/config
```

Useful for CI environments or running multiple independent setups on the same machine. drawlatch **owns this layout as a stable contract** (and migrates legacy key layouts into it automatically on startup):

```
$MCP_CONFIG_DIR/                 (default: ~/.drawlatch)
  remote.config.json    — RemoteServerConfig (callers, connectors, port, tunnel flag)
  proxy.config.json     — ProxyConfig (local MCP proxy → remote URL)
  .env                  — secret values, prefixed per caller (mode 0600)
  enroll.token          — one-time loopback auto-enroll token (mode 0600)
  keys/
    server/             — the daemon's own Ed25519 + X25519 keypair
    callers/<alias>/    — one keypair per caller alias
```

Legacy `keys/local`, `keys/remote`, and `keys/peers/*` directories are migrated to `keys/callers` / `keys/server` on first start — idempotent and safe to re-run.

#### Self-managed tunnel

Set `"tunnel": true` in `remote.config.json` (or `DRAWLATCH_TUNNEL=1` / `drawlatch start --tunnel`) and drawlatch brings up and supervises its own Cloudflare quick tunnel on startup: it learns the public URL, injects it into callback-dependent connection configs (e.g. `TRELLO_CALLBACK_URL`) **before** secret resolution and ingestor start, and surfaces it in `drawlatch status`, the Overview page, and `/api/admin/meta`. It is a config flag, not a runtime control surface.

#### Daemon lifecycle

`drawlatch start` runs the **whole** daemon in one process (MCP protocol + admin API + dashboard UI + optional tunnel). It is daemon-first and cleanly supervisable: a PID file, a deterministic `start` / `stop` / `restart` / `status`, an unauthenticated `/health` endpoint, and `drawlatch start --foreground` for running under a process manager. Local and remote deployments differ only by host binding (`DRAWLATCH_HOST`) and the dashboard password.

## Connections

23 pre-built connection templates ship with drawlatch. Reference them by name in a caller's `connections` list:

| Connection | API | Required Env Var(s) |
|------------|-----|---------------------|
| `anthropic` | Anthropic Claude API | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `bluesky` | Bluesky (AT Protocol) | `BLUESKY_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| `devin` | Devin AI API | `DEVIN_API_KEY` |
| `discord-bot` | Discord Bot API | `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` |
| `discord-oauth` | Discord OAuth2 API | `DISCORD_OAUTH_TOKEN` |
| `github` | GitHub REST API | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `google` | Google Workspace APIs | `GOOGLE_API_TOKEN` |
| `google-ai` | Google AI (Gemini) | `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` |
| `hex` | Hex API | `HEX_TOKEN` |
| `lichess` | Lichess API | `LICHESS_API_TOKEN` |
| `linear` | Linear GraphQL API | `LINEAR_API_KEY` |
| `mastodon` | Mastodon API | `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| `notion` | Notion API | `NOTION_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | OpenAI API | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | OpenRouter API | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `reddit` | Reddit API | `REDDIT_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| `slack` | Slack Web API | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` |
| `stripe` | Stripe Payments API | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` |
| `telegram` | Telegram Bot API | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` |
| `trello` | Trello API | `TRELLO_API_KEY`, `TRELLO_TOKEN` |
| `twitch` | Twitch Helix API | `TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` |
| `x` | X (Twitter) API v2 | `X_BEARER_TOKEN` |

See **[CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md)** for auth details, optional env vars, and usage notes per connection.

## Event Ingestion

Drawlatch can collect real-time events from external services and buffer them for agents to poll. Three ingestor types are supported:

| Type | How It Works | Connections |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **WebSocket** | Persistent connections to event gateways | Discord Gateway, Slack Socket Mode |
| **Webhook** | HTTP receivers with signature verification | GitHub, Stripe, Trello |
| **Poll** | Interval-based HTTP requests | Notion, Linear, Reddit, X, Bluesky, Mastodon, Telegram, Twitch |

Events are stored in per-caller ring buffers (default 200, max 1000) with monotonic IDs for cursor-based pagination. Agents retrieve events via `poll_events` and check status via `ingestor_status`.

For webhook ingestors, the remote server must be publicly accessible (or behind a tunnel). Use `drawlatch start --tunnel` to automatically start a Cloudflare tunnel.

See **[INGESTORS.md](INGESTORS.md)** for full configuration reference.

## Key Exchange

Remote mode requires mutual authentication via Ed25519/X25519 keypairs. Each identity gets four PEM files (signing + exchange, public + private). The `drawlatch init` command handles this automatically for single-machine setups.

**Directory structure:**

```
~/.drawlatch/keys/
├── callers/
│   ├── default/           # Default caller keypair
│   └── alice/             # Additional caller keypair
└── server/                # Server keypair
```

Both sides (caller and server) store their keys in the same directory tree. On a single machine, `drawlatch init` generates both and they can authenticate immediately. On separate machines, copy the `*.pub.pem` files to the corresponding directory on the other machine.

**Using [Callboard](https://github.com/WolpertingerLabs/callboard)?** Use `drawlatch sync` to exchange keys automatically via a double-code approval flow — no manual file copying needed.

### Multiple Agent Identities

Generate a keypair per agent and set `MCP_KEY_ALIAS` at spawn time:

```bash
drawlatch generate-keys caller alice
drawlatch generate-keys caller bob
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "drawlatch": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/mcp/server.js"],
      "env": { "MCP_CONFIG_DIR": "~/.drawlatch", "MCP_KEY_ALIAS": "alice" }
    }
  }
}
```

Register each agent as a separate caller in `remote.config.json`.

  --ttl <seconds>    Session timeout (default: 300)
```

## Library Usage (Local Mode)

Import drawlatch directly for in-process use — no server, no encryption:

```typescript
import { loadRemoteConfig, resolveCallerRoutes, resolveRoutes, resolveSecrets } from "drawlatch/shared/config";
import { executeProxyRequest } from "drawlatch/remote/server";

const config = loadRemoteConfig();
const callerRoutes = resolveCallerRoutes(config, "my-laptop");
const callerEnv = resolveSecrets(config.callers["my-laptop"]?.env ?? {});
const routes = resolveRoutes(callerRoutes, callerEnv);

const result = await executeProxyRequest(
  { method: "GET", url: "https://api.github.com/user" },
  routes,
);
```

### Available Exports

| Export Path | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `drawlatch` | MCP proxy server (stdio transport) |
| `drawlatch/remote/server` | `executeProxyRequest()` and server functions |
| `drawlatch/remote/ingestors` | `IngestorManager` and ingestor types |
| `drawlatch/shared/config` | Config loading, route/secret resolution |
| `drawlatch/shared/connections` | Connection template loading |
| `drawlatch/shared/env-utils` | Environment variable and secret utilities |
| `drawlatch/shared/crypto` | Key generation, encrypted channel |
| `drawlatch/shared/protocol` | Handshake protocol, message types |

## Security Model

### Both Modes

- **Endpoint allowlisting** — requests only proxied to explicitly configured URL patterns
- **Per-caller access control** — each caller only sees their assigned connections
- **Per-caller credential isolation** — same connector, different credentials via `env` overrides
- **Rate limiting** — configurable per-session (default: 60/min)
- **Audit logging** — all operations logged with caller identity, session ID, timestamps

### Remote Mode Only

- **Zero secrets on the client** — the MCP proxy never sees API keys or tokens
- **Mutual authentication** — Ed25519 signatures before any data exchange
- **End-to-end encryption** — AES-256-GCM with X25519 ECDH session keys
- **Replay protection** — monotonic counters on all encrypted messages
- **Session isolation** — unique session keys per handshake, 30-minute TTL
- **File permissions** — private keys `0600`, key directories `0700`
