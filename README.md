# Drawlatch

> **Alpha software:** expect breaking changes between updates.

Drawlatch gives AI agents authenticated access to external APIs without giving them the credentials. A daemon holds your secrets and makes the API calls. Agents reach it through a local MCP server over an end-to-end encrypted, mutually authenticated channel, and can only call the URL patterns each connection allows.

- **32 pre-built connections** (GitHub, Slack, Discord, Stripe, Notion, Linear, OpenAI, …) plus your own custom connectors. See [CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md).
- **Per-caller access control.** Each agent identity (caller) sees only its own connections and secrets.
- **Real-time events.** WebSocket, webhook, and polling listeners buffer events for agents to read. See [INGESTORS.md](INGESTORS.md).
- **Admin dashboard** for callers, connections, secrets, and listeners, served by the daemon itself.

**Using [Callboard](https://github.com/WolpertingerLabs/callboard)?** Drawlatch is built in. Callboard manages connections, secrets, and agent identities through its UI, so you don't need to set up drawlatch separately.

## How it works

```
Claude Code ◄─ stdio ─► MCP server (local, no secrets) ◄─ HTTP + E2EE ─► drawlatch daemon (holds secrets) ─ HTTPS ─► API
```

The local MCP server holds only its caller keypair and the daemon's public keys. Each session starts with a handshake: Ed25519 signatures for mutual authentication, then X25519 ECDH to derive AES-256-GCM session keys. The daemon matches each request to an allowlisted connection, injects that connection's headers and secrets, and makes the call. All crypto uses Node's built-in `crypto` module.

## Quick start (single machine)

Requires Node.js 22 or later.

```bash
npm install -g @wolpertingerlabs/drawlatch

drawlatch init            # server keypair, configs and .env in ~/.drawlatch
drawlatch set-password    # dashboard password (at least 8 characters)
drawlatch start           # start the daemon in the background
```

`init` is idempotent and never overwrites existing files. Annotated examples: [`remote.config.example.json`](remote.config.example.json), [`proxy.config.example.json`](proxy.config.example.json), and [`.env.example`](.env.example) (append only the lines you need to `~/.drawlatch/.env`; don't overwrite it, it also holds the dashboard password hash). It writes `"host": "0.0.0.0"`, so the daemon listens on every interface (the dashboard is password-protected; set `"host": "127.0.0.1"` in `~/.drawlatch/remote.config.json` for loopback only). It does not create a caller. Create one next.

**Create a caller.** The local MCP server authenticates as the caller named by `MCP_KEY_ALIAS` (default: `default`), using the keypair in `~/.drawlatch/keys/callers/<alias>/`. Either:

- **Dashboard:** open `http://127.0.0.1:9999/`, go to **Callers → New caller**, name it `default`, then on **Connections** enable `github` and set `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Changes apply immediately.
- **CLI:**

  ```bash
  drawlatch generate-keys caller default
  # In ~/.drawlatch/remote.config.json, set:  "callers": { "default": { "connections": ["github"] } }
  echo 'DEFAULT_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token' >> ~/.drawlatch/.env   # secrets are prefixed with the caller alias
  drawlatch restart
  ```

**Register the MCP server with Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add drawlatch -- node "$(npm root -g)/@wolpertingerlabs/drawlatch/dist/mcp/server.js"
```

Add `-e MCP_KEY_ALIAS=<alias>` (before `--`) to use a caller other than `default`, and `-e MCP_CONFIG_DIR=/abs/path` for a config directory other than `~/.drawlatch`. Use absolute paths: a `~` inside an MCP `env` value is not expanded.

**Check the setup:**

```bash
drawlatch doctor    # config, keys, required secrets, daemon health
drawlatch status    # PID, port, uptime, active sessions, dashboard URL
```

This repo is also a Claude Code plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/`): `/plugin marketplace add WolpertingerLabs/drawlatch`, then `/plugin install drawlatch@drawlatch`. Its MCP server is named `secure-proxy` and passes `MCP_CONFIG_DIR` and `MCP_KEY_ALIAS` through from your environment.

## Daemon and MCP server on different machines

The MCP server reads PEM files only, so you exchange public keys by hand:

1. **Client machine:** install drawlatch, run `drawlatch generate-keys caller laptop`, and create `~/.drawlatch/proxy.config.json` with `"remoteUrl": "http://<daemon-host>:9999"` (see [Proxy config](#proxy-config-proxyconfigjson)). Don't run `init` here; it would create an unrelated server keypair.
2. Copy the client's `keys/callers/laptop/*.pub.pem` to the daemon machine's `~/.drawlatch/keys/callers/laptop/`, and add `"laptop": { "connections": [...] }` to its `callers`.
3. Copy the daemon's `keys/server/*.pub.pem` to the client's `~/.drawlatch/keys/server/`.
4. `drawlatch restart` on the daemon, then register the MCP server on the client with `-e MCP_KEY_ALIAS=laptop`.

Traffic is encrypted end to end, but the dashboard cookie is not marked `secure`. Put the daemon behind a TLS-terminating proxy if you expose it beyond a trusted network.

**Callboard instances** use credential bundles instead: `drawlatch issue-caller <alias> -o <alias>.drawlatch-caller.json` (or **Issue credentials** on the dashboard's caller page), then import the file in Callboard. On the same host, `--into <callboard keys dir>` writes the key files directly. Issuing mints a new keypair and keeps only its public half, so **issuing for an existing alias rotates its keys** and deletes any private key drawlatch held for it. After a CLI issue, `drawlatch restart` so a running daemon accepts the new key; dashboard issues apply immediately.

A co-located Callboard can also provision itself. When the daemon starts with `DRAWLATCH_LOCAL_CALLER_KEYS_DIR` set and the caller named by `DRAWLATCH_LOCAL_CALLER_ALIAS` (default `callboard-local`; Callboard sets `default`) is missing from config or has no keys, drawlatch issues it and writes the caller keys to `<dir>/callers/<alias>/` and the server public keys to `<dir>/server/`. `DRAWLATCH_LOCAL_CALLER_CONNECTIONS` (comma-separated) sets its connections. If that is unset, it keeps the existing entry's connections or copies the `default` caller's.

## MCP tools

The local MCP server exposes these tools. Every call goes through the encrypted channel and runs as the authenticated caller.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `secure_request` | HTTP request to an allowlisted URL. Connection headers are injected for you. `${VAR}` placeholders in the URL and headers resolve server-side from the matched connection's secrets (in the body only if the connection sets `resolveSecretsInBody`). Redirects are followed only within the connection's allowlist ([Redirects](#redirects)). Supports multipart uploads from local files (25 MB per file, 50 MB per base64-encoded request): with `files`, the JSON `body` is sent as a form part named `payload_json` (change it with `bodyFieldName`). Also takes a per-call `timeoutMs`. |
| `list_routes` | The caller's connections: docs links, allowed endpoint patterns, the *names* of secrets that are set, auto-injected header names, `awsSigV4` settings, timeouts, listener info. |
| `test_connection` | Run a connection's built-in credential check. Some cost a little credit; see [CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md#available-connections). |
| `list_connection_templates` | All built-in templates, with which are enabled for this caller and which secrets are set (booleans). Custom connectors aren't listed. |
| `set_connection_enabled` | Enable or disable a connection for this caller. |
| `set_secrets` | Set or delete (empty string) this caller's secrets. Write-only. |
| `get_secret_status` | Which required and optional secrets are set for a built-in connection (booleans). |
| `poll_events` | Read buffered listener events after a cursor. |
| `ingestor_status` | State, buffer size, event counts, and errors for this caller's listeners. |
| `control_listener` | Start, stop, or restart a listener. |
| `list_listener_configs` | Configurable listener fields per connection. |
| `get_listener_params` / `set_listener_params` | Read or change listener parameters. |
| `resolve_listener_options` | Fetch dynamic choices for a listener field (for example, your Trello boards). |
| `list_listener_instances` / `delete_listener_instance` | Manage multi-instance listeners. |
| `test_ingestor` | Check a listener's configuration and credentials. |

Note that `set_secrets` and `set_connection_enabled` let an agent change its own caller's configuration. It still can't read secret values or reach URLs outside the allowlists.

The daemon also accepts `wait_for_events`, a long-poll over all of a caller's event streams. The local MCP server doesn't expose it; long-running clients such as Callboard call it over the encrypted channel. See [INGESTORS.md](INGESTORS.md#reading-events).

## Configuration

### Config directory

Everything lives in `~/.drawlatch/`, or `$MCP_CONFIG_DIR` if set:

```
remote.config.json     daemon config: callers, custom connectors, host/port, rate limit, tunnel
proxy.config.json      local MCP server config: daemon URL and timeouts
.env                   secrets (mode 0600), plus the dashboard password hash
keys/server/           the daemon's Ed25519 + X25519 keypair
keys/callers/<alias>/  one keypair per caller (public half only, when issued as a bundle)
logs/drawlatch.log     daemon log (drawlatch logs)
data/sessions.json     dashboard login sessions
drawlatch.pid          PID of the background daemon
```

Each key directory holds `signing.{pub,key}.pem` and `exchange.{pub,key}.pem`. Private keys are written `0600` and key directories `0700`. On startup the daemon moves the legacy `keys/local`, `keys/remote`, and `keys/peers/*` layouts into this one.

### Daemon config (`remote.config.json`)

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | `127.0.0.1` (`init` writes `0.0.0.0`) | Bind address. Env override: `DRAWLATCH_HOST`, or `drawlatch start --host`. |
| `port` | `9999` | Listen port. Env override: `DRAWLATCH_PORT`, or `--port`. |
| `rateLimitPerMinute` | `240` (`init` writes `60`) | Encrypted requests per minute per session. Over the limit, the daemon returns `429` with `Retry-After`. |
| `callers` | `{}` | Caller aliases and what each may use (see below). |
| `connectors` | `[]` | Custom connector definitions (see below). |
| `tunnel` | `false` | Start a Cloudflare quick tunnel at boot. Env override: `DRAWLATCH_TUNNEL=1`, or `--tunnel`. |

`LOG_LEVEL` in `.env` or the environment sets daemon log verbosity: `error`, `warn`, `info` (default), or `debug`.

The daemon re-reads `remote.config.json` for each new session and after dashboard changes. Hand edits that add callers or change listeners need `drawlatch restart`.

### Callers

```json
{
  "callers": {
    "default": { "connections": ["github", "stripe", "internal-api"] },
    "ci": { "name": "CI runner", "connections": ["github"] }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `connections` | Required. Built-in connection names or custom connector aliases. |
| `name` | Display name for logs and the dashboard. |
| `env` | Per-caller secret values (see [Secrets](#secrets)). |
| `ingestorOverrides`, `listenerInstances` | Listener settings ([INGESTORS.md](INGESTORS.md#per-caller-listener-settings)). |
| `triggerRules` | Forward matching events to Claude Code remote triggers ([INGESTORS.md](INGESTORS.md#trigger-rules-experimental)). |

Caller public keys are read from `keys/callers/<alias>/`. Aliases must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`.

### Secrets

Connections reference secrets as `${NAME}` (for example, `${GITHUB_TOKEN}`). For caller `<alias>`, the daemon looks up `NAME` in this order:

1. A literal value in the caller's `env` map: `"env": { "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_..." }`.
2. The environment variable `<ALIAS>_<NAME>`, with the alias uppercased and `-` replaced by `_`. Examples: `DEFAULT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `MY_AGENT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

A bare `GITHUB_TOKEN` is never used. This keeps one caller from picking up another's credentials. The daemon loads `.env` at startup, so restart after editing it by hand. The dashboard and `set_secrets` write `<ALIAS>_<NAME>` to `.env` and apply the change immediately.

If a secret isn't set, its placeholder is sent literally (for example, `Authorization: Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}`), and the upstream API will usually answer `401`. An [`awsSigV4`](#aws-sigv4-signing) connection without its signing keys fails the request instead of sending it. `drawlatch doctor`, `drawlatch config`, and the dashboard's Secrets page show what's missing. They check only built-in templates, and only secrets used in a template's headers or, for an `awsSigV4` template, its signing keys: custom connectors are skipped, and a token that goes in the URL (Telegram, Trello) isn't flagged. `doctor` also prints the unprefixed name ("Set GITHUB_TOKEN in …/.env"); whatever it says, set `<ALIAS>_<NAME>` (`DEFAULT_GITHUB_TOKEN` for the default caller).

> **Known issue:** an `env` value that redirects to another variable, such as `"GITHUB_TOKEN": "${ALICE_TOKEN}"`, is ignored; the prefixed variable (`<ALIAS>_GITHUB_TOKEN`) is used if set. Status checks still report the redirected secret as set. Use a literal value or the prefixed variable instead.

### Custom connectors

Use these for APIs without a built-in template, or to override one: a connector whose `alias` matches a built-in name replaces that template.

```json
{
  "connectors": [
    {
      "alias": "internal-api",
      "name": "Internal Admin API",
      "allowedEndpoints": ["https://admin.internal.example/**"],
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${ADMIN_KEY}" },
      "secrets": { "ADMIN_KEY": "${ADMIN_KEY}" }
    }
  ]
}
```

With this connector, caller `default` reads `ADMIN_KEY` from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_KEY`.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `alias` | Required. Name referenced from a caller's `connections`. |
| `allowedEndpoints` | Required. URL globs: `*` matches within a path segment, `**` across segments. An empty list matches nothing. |
| `headers` | Headers injected into every request. `${VAR}` resolves against `secrets`. A request that sets the same header itself is rejected. |
| `awsSigV4` | Sign every request with AWS Signature Version 4: `{}`, or `{ "service": "…", "region": "…" }` to override what's inferred from the hostname. See [AWS SigV4 signing](#aws-sigv4-signing). |
| `secrets` | `NAME → value`. The value is a literal, or `${VAR}` resolved per caller as in [Secrets](#secrets). |
| `resolveSecretsInBody` | Resolve `${VAR}` in request bodies. Default `false`, which stops an agent from writing a placeholder into a resource and reading the secret back. |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | Default outbound timeout for this API, and the most a caller may request (see [Request timeouts](#request-timeouts)). |
| `name`, `description`, `docsUrl`, `openApiUrl` | Shown to agents by `list_routes`. |
| `testConnection`, `ingestor`, `listenerConfig`, `testIngestor` | Credential test and event listener definitions. Built-in templates in `src/connections/` are the reference. |

#### AWS SigV4 signing

AWS APIs need a signature computed per request, so a static header can't authenticate them. A connector with `awsSigV4` gets one from the daemon instead. After the URL, headers, and body are final, the daemon signs the exact bytes it sends and adds `Authorization`, `X-Amz-Date`, `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` (the SHA-256 of the body), and `X-Amz-Security-Token` when a session token is set. The built-in [`aws`](CONNECTIONS.md#notes-by-connection) template uses it.

- **Credentials** are the connector's `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` secrets, plus `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` for temporary credentials. They resolve per caller like any other secret, so `"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "${PROD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"` in `secrets` points a connector at different variables. The first two count as required. If either is missing, the request fails without being sent. Only the signer reads these three. They, and any other secret whose value contains one of them, are never substituted for `${VAR}` in a URL, a header, a connector's own `headers`, a body with `resolveSecretsInBody`, or a listener's requests; a request that references one is rejected.
- **Service and region** come from the request hostname: `<service>.<region>.amazonaws.com`, `<id>.<service>.<region>.amazonaws.com` (API Gateway, SageMaker runtime), `<id>.<region>.<service>.amazonaws.com` (OpenSearch), interface VPC endpoints (`vpce-….<service>.<region>.vpce.amazonaws.com`), and S3's virtual-hosted, path-style, dual-stack, and legacy `s3-<region>` hosts, with `s3-outposts` and `s3-object-lambda` as their own signing names. A global endpoint such as `sts.amazonaws.com` or `iam.amazonaws.com` signs for `us-east-1`, and `iam.us-gov.amazonaws.com` for `us-gov-west-1`. A few endpoint prefixes map to a different signing name (`bedrock-runtime` and `bedrock-agent*` → `bedrock`, `email` → `ses`, `aps-workspaces` → `aps`). For anything else, set `service` and `region` explicitly, which overrides the inference for every request on that connector.
- **Reserved names.** A request may not set `Authorization`, `Host`, `X-Amz-Date`, `X-Amz-Content-Sha256`, or `X-Amz-Security-Token`, or carry presigned-URL query parameters (`X-Amz-Signature`, `X-Amz-Credential`, and so on). Such a request is rejected. Other `x-amz-*` headers, such as `X-Amz-Target` or `x-amz-meta-*`, are sent and signed.
- **What's signed:** `host`, every header sent except hop-by-hop ones (`connection`, `user-agent`, `content-length`, and similar), and the body. A string body is sent as UTF-8, with fetch's default `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` content type unless you set one. Multipart uploads are serialized before signing. Paths are normalized and encoded per segment as SigV4 requires. S3 paths are encoded once and not normalized. The URL itself is parsed first, which already resolves `.` and `..` segments (including `%2E%2E`), so S3 keys containing those segments can't be reached.
- **Redirects** aren't followed, even to the same host: the signature covers the original URL. A 3xx comes back to the caller with its `Location` header (see [Redirects](#redirects)).

### Proxy config (`proxy.config.json`)

Read by the local MCP server, which won't connect without this file. `init` writes it. Fields missing from the file fall back to these defaults.

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteUrl` | `http://localhost:9999` (`init` writes `http://127.0.0.1:9999`) | Daemon URL. |
| `connectTimeout` | `10000` | Handshake timeout (ms). |
| `requestTimeout` | `185000` | Local → daemon deadline (ms) for calls that don't pass `timeoutMs`. It also caps the daemon's outbound budget. |

Keys are read from `keys/callers/<MCP_KEY_ALIAS or "default">/` and `keys/server/`.

### Request timeouts

A proxied call has three nested deadlines. The innermost fires first, because only the daemon's outbound fetch can actually cancel the upstream call:

| Layer | Deadline | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| daemon → upstream API | per-call `timeoutMs`, else the connection's `requestTimeoutMs`, else 25 s. Capped by the connection's `requestTimeoutMs` (or 290 s), then by the local budget. | `25000` |
| MCP server → daemon | `timeoutMs + 5000`, else `requestTimeout` | `185000` |
| MCP client → MCP server | your client's tool timeout (`MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` in Claude Code) | `60000` |

- The MCP server sends the daemon an outbound budget of its own deadline minus 5 s, so the outbound leg always finishes first. Passing `timeoutMs` widens the local deadline to match.
- `exa`, `firecrawl`, and `parallel` allow up to 120 s, and `perplexity` up to 180 s. All four exceed the MCP client's 60 s default, so raise `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` to use the full ceiling. They already fit under the default `requestTimeout`. For long jobs, prefer the API's async submit-and-poll endpoints.
- `list_routes` reports each connection's `defaultTimeoutMs` and `maxTimeoutMs` under the current budget.
- The 290 s outbound maximum sits below undici's internal 300 s headers timeout, which would otherwise fire first with an opaque error.
- A timed-out call is cancelled at the socket and reported as `Upstream request timed out after <n>ms`. If the local budget was the binding limit, the error names the setting to raise. A host that never accepts the connection is reported as `Upstream never accepted the connection`.
- The MCP server accepts `timeoutMs` only as a positive integer up to 290000. The daemon treats invalid values from other clients as unset. A malformed `requestTimeoutMs` on a connection falls back to 25 s; it doesn't remove the ceiling.

### Redirects

The daemon follows redirects itself rather than leaving them to fetch, whose default forwards every header except `Authorization` and `Cookie` to wherever `Location` points. For a proxied request (`secure_request`, `test_connection`, `test_ingestor`, `resolve_listener_options`), each hop is checked first:

- **Allowlist:** the target must match the same connection's `allowedEndpoints`, on the same host or another one.
- **No downgrade:** an `https` URL never redirects to `http`, even on the same host.
- **Cross-origin headers:** when the scheme, host, or port changes, only `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`, and `User-Agent` go along, and only when their value contains none of the connection's secrets. Connection headers such as `x-api-key`, `Circle-Token`, `DD-API-KEY`, or Twitch's `Client-Id`, and caller headers with resolved placeholders, are dropped for that hop and every later one. A same-origin hop keeps all headers, and so does a plain upgrade from `http` on port 80 to `https` on port 443 with the same hostname. Any other port change counts as cross-origin.
- **Method and body:** 301 and 302 turn a `POST` into a `GET`, 303 turns anything but `GET` or `HEAD` into a `GET`, and both drop the body and its content headers. 307 and 308 resend the method and body, multipart uploads included. If `resolveSecretsInBody` substituted a secret into the body, a 307 or 308 to another origin isn't followed, since the body would go there as-is.
- **Limit:** at most 5 hops.

A hop that fails a check isn't followed and isn't an error. The 3xx comes back as the result, with its `Location` header, and the target is never contacted. Secrets in response header values, such as a refused `Location` that echoes `?key=…` back, are shown as `${NAME}`, both as-is and URL-encoded. When redirects were followed, the result has a `url` field with the final URL, scrubbed the same way.

`awsSigV4` connections never follow redirects. Listener requests (polls, webhook auto-registration, Slack Socket Mode connect) and trigger dispatch follow redirects only on the request URL's own origin; see [INGESTORS.md](INGESTORS.md#polling).

### Webhooks and the tunnel

Webhook listeners (GitHub, Stripe, Trello) receive `POST /webhooks/<path>` on the daemon's port, so the daemon must be reachable from the internet. `drawlatch start --tunnel` (or `"tunnel": true`) runs a Cloudflare quick tunnel; [`cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) must be installed. The tunnel URL appears in `drawlatch status`, and the daemon sets any unset callback-URL variable a webhook template references (for example, `TRELLO_CALLBACK_URL`) before starting listeners. Details: [INGESTORS.md](INGESTORS.md#webhooks).

## Admin dashboard

The daemon serves a web dashboard and its JSON API from the same port as the MCP protocol: `http://127.0.0.1:9999/` by default. From it you can create, issue, and delete callers; enable connections; set secrets; configure, test, and control listeners; and watch events, ingestors, sessions, and a secrets matrix. Connection and secret changes apply to open sessions immediately. Running listeners pick up new secrets, or a newly enabled connection, only when they are (re)started: use the listener controls or `drawlatch restart`. Listener parameter changes restart the listener.

**Password.** The dashboard stays locked until a password is set. `drawlatch set-password` (alias `change-password`) prompts on a TTY or reads the password twice from stdin (`printf '%s\n%s\n' "$PW" "$PW" | drawlatch set-password`). It stores a scrypt hash and salt in `.env` as `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` / `AUTH_PASSWORD_SALT`. Restart the daemon after setting it from the CLI. Changing it from the dashboard (**Change password**, `/settings/password`) applies immediately and signs out every other session.

**Security.**

- The password, not loopback, is the trust boundary. That's why the daemon can bind `0.0.0.0`.
- The session cookie (`drawlatch_session`) is `httpOnly` and `sameSite=strict`, with a 7-day rolling expiry. It has no `secure` flag, so use a TLS-terminating proxy beyond a trusted network.
- Per-IP rate limits:
  - login and password change: 3/min combined
  - auth check and logout: 20/min
  - `/handshake`: 30/min
  - `/webhooks`: 120/min
  - `/health`: 60/min
  - `/api/admin`: 300/min, with credential issuance limited to 10/min
- Without a password, the MCP protocol still works. Login, auth checks, and `/api/admin/*` return `503`.

**API.** The dashboard is a client of `/api/admin/*` (paths below are relative to it). Read endpoints report secrets as booleans only:

- `GET /meta`, `/health`, `/connections`, `/callers`, `/ingestors`, `/sessions`, `/secrets`
- `GET /callers/:alias/connections`, `/callers/:alias/connection-status`, `/callers/:alias/ingestors`, `/callers/:alias/events`, `/callers/:alias/listener-configs`

Write endpoints (`…` = `/callers/:alias/connections/:connection`):

| Method and path | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /callers` `{alias, name?, connections?}` | Create a caller with a keypair on drawlatch's disk |
| `POST /callers/:alias/issue` `{connections?, endpointUrl?, passphrase?, name?}` | Issue or rotate a credential bundle (10/min) |
| `DELETE /callers/:alias` | Delete a caller, its keys, and the secrets recorded in its `env` map (set via the dashboard or `set_secrets`; hand-added `.env` lines remain). `default` is protected |
| `PUT /tunnel` `{enabled}` | Persist the tunnel flag (applies on restart) |
| `POST …` `{enabled}` | Enable or disable a connection |
| `PUT …/secrets` `{secrets}` | Set secrets; empty string deletes |
| `POST …/test`, `POST …/test-ingestor` | Run the connection or listener test |
| `POST …/listener/control` `{action, instance_id?}` | Start, stop or restart a listener |
| `GET`/`PUT …/listener/params` | Read or set listener params |
| `GET`/`POST …/listener/instances`, `DELETE …/listener/instances/:instanceId` | Manage listener instances |
| `POST …/listener/resolve-options` `{paramKey}` | Fetch dynamic field options |

Connection and listener operations share their implementation with the MCP tools (`src/remote/tool-dispatch.ts`). The unauthenticated `GET /health` returns status, active session count, uptime, and the tunnel URL.

## Security model

- **Endpoint allowlisting:** requests go only to URLs matching the caller's connections. Redirects are followed only to allowlisted URLs, never from `https` to `http`, and without credential headers across origins ([Redirects](#redirects)).
- **Per-caller isolation:** each caller sees only its connections, and secrets resolve only from its own `env` or `<ALIAS>_`-prefixed variables.
- **No secrets on the client:** the MCP server never holds API credentials. Secret placeholders resolve server-side, in request bodies only when a connection opts in.
- **Mutual authentication:** Ed25519-signed handshake against a pinned server key and registered caller keys.
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with per-session X25519 ECDH keys, and monotonic counters against replay.
- **Sessions** expire after 30 minutes idle.
- **Rate limits** apply per session (`rateLimitPerMinute`) and per IP on unauthenticated endpoints.
- **Audit log:** every request and response is logged with caller and session (`drawlatch logs --requests`).

## Package exports

Drawlatch is mainly a CLI and daemon. Hosts such as Callboard can import these subpaths; any other deep import fails with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

| Export | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `@wolpertingerlabs/drawlatch` | The MCP stdio server (`dist/mcp/server.js`). Importing it starts the server. |
| `…/shared/crypto` | Key generation, loading and fingerprints, `EncryptedChannel` |
| `…/shared/protocol` | `HandshakeInitiator` / `HandshakeResponder` and wire message types |
| `…/shared/migrations` | Idempotent config-dir migrations (`migrateKeyLayout`, `migrateConfigDir`) |
| `…/remote/server` | Daemon entry point. Resolve its path and run it with `node`; it isn't a library API. |
| `…/remote/caller-bootstrap` | `CALLER_ALIAS_REGEX` and caller creation and issuance helpers |
| `…/remote/admin-types` | Admin API types, including the caller bundle format (`CallerBundleV1`) |

## Development

```bash
npm install               # also builds (prepare script)
