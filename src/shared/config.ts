 *     from the deadline it actually armed, minus LOCAL_TIMEOUT_SLACK_MS. The

 *     always strictly smaller than the local leg regardless of what the
 *     connection's `requestTimeoutMs` says.
 *   - Upward: a caller-supplied `timeoutMs` raises the local deadline to
 *     `timeoutMs + LOCAL_TIMEOUT_SLACK_MS`, so asking for a longer upstream
 *     call widens the outer layer to match instead of being cut short by it.
 *
 * Slack is subtracted exactly once, by the layer that owns it (the local
