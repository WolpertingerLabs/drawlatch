/**
 * fetch() with redirects followed by hand, under a per-call policy.
 *
 * fetch()'s own `redirect: 'follow'` is unsafe for a request that carries
 * secrets. On a cross-origin hop it strips only `Authorization` and `Cookie`
 * (and `Proxy-Authorization`); every other header — `x-api-key`,
 * `Circle-Token`, `DD-API-KEY`, a caller header with a resolved `${SECRET}` —
 * goes to whatever host the `Location` names, and that host is never checked
 * against anything. An https → http hop goes out in cleartext.
 *
 * Here every hop is checked before it is sent:
 *
 *   - The target must parse, be http(s), and pass `isAllowed` (for proxied
 *     requests, the matched route's `allowedEndpoints`).
 *   - https → http is never followed, same host or not.
 *   - A cross-origin hop (scheme, host, or port differs from the previous
 *     URL) sends only `crossOriginHeaders`. Everything else is dropped.
 *   - Method and body follow the fetch spec: 301/302 turn a POST into a GET,
 *     303 turns anything but GET/HEAD into a GET, and both drop the body and
 *     its content headers; 307/308 resend the method and body unchanged
 *     (bodies are typed to kinds that can be sent twice).
 *   - At most `maxRedirects` hops (default MAX_REDIRECTS).
 *
 * A hop that fails any of these is not an error: the 3xx itself is returned,
 * `Location` and all, and the caller decides what to do with it.
